# Credit_card_fraud_detection
In this brief study, we will try to identify the best ML model for identifying fraudulent credit card transactions, using a deeply inbalanced dataset.

The sampling method is undersampling (1:1 ratio of target classes) which will be extended to weighted undersampling(1:100 ratio) to try to confirm our results.

The models we will use are:

Logistic Model
Random Forest
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Support vector Classifier
They will be trained using scikit-learn and specifically optimized using GridSearchCV.
